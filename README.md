# 0x11 C - printf Team Project

Welcome to our team project! In this project, we will be implementing a function to produce output according to a specific format. Below are the details and requirements for the project:

## 1. Introduction

"I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life."

## 2. Conversion Specifiers

Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't. We need to handle the following conversion specifiers:

- `%d`: Signed integer (decimal)
- `%i`: Signed integer (base 10)
- `%u`: Unsigned integer
- `%o`: Unsigned octal
- `%x`: Unsigned hexadecimal (lowercase)
- `%X`: Unsigned hexadecimal (uppercase)

## 3. Custom Conversion Specifiers

"With a face like mine, I do better in print." We also need to handle the following custom conversion specifier:

- `%R`: Custom conversion specifier 1

## 4. Buffer Optimization

"Nothing in fine print is ever good news." To optimize the output process, we will use a local buffer of 1024 characters to call write as little as possible.

## 5. Handling Additional Custom Conversion Specifier

"My weakness is wearing too much leopard print." Additionally, we need to handle the following custom conversion specifier:

- `%L`: Custom conversion specifier 2

## 6. Printing Pointers

"How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print." We will handle the `%p` conversion specifier for printing pointers.

## 7. Flag Characters

"The big print gives and the small print takes away." For non-custom conversion specifiers, we will handle the following flag characters:

- `0`: Zero-padding flag
- `-`: Left-justify flag

## 8. Length Modifiers

"Sarcasm is lost in print." We will handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:

- `l`: Long
- `h`: Short

## 9. Field Width

"Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests." We need to handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

## 10. Precision Handling

"The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance." We will handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

## 11. Handling the '0' Flag Character

"It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print." We need to handle the `0` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

## 12. Handling the '-' Flag Character

"Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print whatever, suddenly I would see a collection." We will handle the `-` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

## 13. Custom Conversion Specifier

"Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party." Additionally, we need to handle the following custom conversion specifier:

- `%E`: Custom conversion specifier 3

## 14. Additional Custom Conversion Specifier

"The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring." Finally, we will handle the following custom conversion specifier:

- `%G`: Custom conversion specifier 4

## 15. Conclusion

All the above options work well together to create a powerful and flexible `printf` function for our project. Let's collaborate and make this project a success!
